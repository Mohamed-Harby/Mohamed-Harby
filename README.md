### Hi there 👋


I'm Mohamed Harby, a software engineer and a seasoned competitive programmer based in Giza, Egypt. I started coding when I was 13 with Visual Basic, turned to Java at 16, and later, I switched to other languages like C++, Python, and JS, and now I'm back in the Java world. I’m determined to stay engaged and make the most of life!
