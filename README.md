<h4>اَللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ , وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ , كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ , وَبَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ , وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ , كَمَا بَارَكْتَ عَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ فِي اَلْعَالَمِينَ إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ. </h4>

<h4>O Allah, bless Muhammad and the members of his family as You have blessed Ibrahim, and grant favours to Muhammad and the members of his family as You have granted favours to Ibrahim. In the worlds You are indeed Praiseworthy and Glorious.</h4>
